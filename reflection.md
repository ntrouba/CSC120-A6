- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
For this HW assignment I collaborated with Lily Garner and Liberty Lehr. 
 I like inheritance because it allows classes to take on attributes without having to rewrite them for each one you want. This assignment went over rather smoothly, the hardest part was creating the inventory for the cafe. In the future, I would encourage other students to get creative with this assignment and add cool attributes.
